## Sky Shooter!

The goal of this project is to create a Javascript Shooter Game using Phaser 3, as specified in the Microverse Program.
The "Sky Shooter Game" is a JavaScript-based implementation of a Phaser 3 game. It's a game for one person only. To win points and bullets, the player must shoot adversaries in the sky. The game ends when a player is shot by an enemy or when his or her bullets run out. The Leaderboard shows each player's score.

## Game Concept

> Sky Shooter is the first game I've ever designed. When I was little, I got my inspiration from a simple Star Wars game that I used to watch my buddies play. I had no idea that one day I would be able to create my own game!

## Main Objective

> To earn additional points and ammunition, you must shoot enemies. 
> A point is awarded to you when you defeat an enemy. 
> You can use the keyboard "Spacebar" to shoot down adversaries as a player. 
> Beat the high scores of other players! The score of a player is saved locally in the browser and compared against prior results.
> If a player's score exceeds the previous score, they are promoted to the top of the LeadersBoard.
