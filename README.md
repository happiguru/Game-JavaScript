## Game Concept

> Sky Shooter is the first game I have programmed. I picked my idea from simple Star wars game I use to watch my friends play when I was young. Little did I know that some day I will be a able to build a game for myself! 

## Main Objective

> You have to shoot enemies to get more points and bullets.
> When you destroy an enemy, you get rewarded with a point.
> As a player, you can shoot down enemies using the keyboard "Spacebar".
> Beat other players' highscores!
> A players score is recorded locally in the browser and compared to the previous scores.
> If a player score beats the previous score, then they automatically become the highest on the LeadersBoard.
